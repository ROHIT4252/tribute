        <h2> Missile man of india </h2>
        <p> Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR (/ˈɑːbdəl kəˈlɑːm/ ⓘ; 15 October 1931 – 27 
            July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th 
            president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil 
            Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades 
            as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development
             Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately 
             involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts
             .[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
              development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] 
              He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in 
              India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear
               test by India in 1974.[5]
